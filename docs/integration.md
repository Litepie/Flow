# Integration

This document explains how to integrate Litepie Flow with your Laravel application.

- Register workflows in a service provider.
- Use the `HasWorkflow` trait on your models.
- Use the `Flow` facade to interact with workflows programmatically.

See the main README for more details and examples.
